# Vandal

Tray-resident Windows screen capture + markup tool. Tauri 2 (Rust) + React/TS (Vite).
**Read `internal/PLAN.md` before starting work** (its Status section says where we are). Work only
on the current phase unless asked. Current phase: **3 (polish, private beta testing)**. Plan each
sub-phase with the user first, then build one feature per increment, confirmed by the user and
committed before the next one. Warn the user before changes that restart the dev app (Rust,
`Cargo.toml`, `tauri.conf.json`): they are often using it. Commit here once an increment is
confirmed, but don't push unless asked.

`internal/` holds our private notes. It's a separate private git repo and is gitignored here:
commit its changes in `internal/`, never in this repo, and push them right away. If it's missing,
ask the user for it rather than working without the plan. Only `PLAN.md` is read up front; the rest
when needed: `done.md` (finished phases' detail, e.g. what "PLAN 3D.18" in a comment means),
`ideas.md` (backlog, Phases 4–5), `decisions.md` (the decisions log: append, search rather than
read whole), `test-matrix.md`, `perf.md`, `mockup/`, `screenshot-kit/` (remote-controls the
installed app to take marketing screenshots or run end-to-end checks; its `CLAUDE.md` says how).

## Non-negotiables (PLAN §1)

- Capture pixels _before_ showing/focusing anything when the hotkey fires.
- Rust owns the pixels. No image data over JSON IPC; the webview fetches frames from the
  `capture://` protocol (`http://capture.localhost/frame/{id}/{monitor}`).
- Physical pixels in virtual-desktop coordinates (can be negative) are the source of truth.
  CSS conversion happens only at the display edge, per monitor (`geometry.rs` / `geometry.ts`).
- Capture/window enumeration/OCR sit behind traits (`capture::Capturer`).

## Conventions

- All Tauri commands go in `src-tauri/src/commands.rs` with `#[specta::specta]`. TS bindings
  are generated into `src/shared/bindings.ts` on every debug run (commit it). Frontend calls go
  through `src/shared/ipc.ts`, never raw `invoke` strings.
- Tauri capabilities are minimal and per-window. Overlays get no filesystem access.
- New dependencies follow `DEVELOPMENT.md` › Dependencies: check a package when the feature
  is planned (advisories, maintenance, owner, a week old), not after it's built; the commit
  message says why we need it and that it was checked. An `npm install` that hangs means the
  version is under `.npmrc`'s 7-day minimum.
- If the plan turns out to be wrong, update `internal/PLAN.md` at the same time (committed in
  `internal/`) and add to `internal/decisions.md`.
- Small, focused commits that explain _why_.

## Before calling a task done

```
cd src-tauri && cargo fmt && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test
npm run lint && npm test && npx tsc --noEmit
npm run ext:build   # if extension/ changed (browser extension, PLAN 3N)
npm run security    # if dependencies or lockfiles changed (npm audit + cargo deny)
npm run tauri:dev   # smoke run (dev identity; coexists with an installed copy)
```

Never edit source files with Windows PowerShell `Get-Content`/`Set-Content`: 5.1 reads UTF-8 as
Windows-1252 and corrupts non-ASCII text (`src/shared/encoding.test.ts` catches this).

Run Node tooling from PowerShell. Git Bash on this machine has an old nvm Node 16 first on PATH.

## Settings

- Rust (`settings.rs`) is the source of truth; every change goes through `settings::update`
  (validate, save, apply live, broadcast `SettingsChanged`).
- To add a setting: add the field (with a default) to the Rust struct, then add an item to
  `src/settings/sections.tsx`. New control kind: extend `Item` in `schema.ts` and register a
  component in `controls/index.ts`.
- If applying a setting needs side effects (re-register, rebuild a menu...), add them to
  `settings::update`.

## Handy

- Hotkeys (defaults): `Win+F12` region, `Win+Shift+F12` full screen. Overlay keys: Enter/double-click
  confirm, F this screen, A all screens, arrows nudge, Ctrl+arrows resize from the bottom-right (Shift = 10px),
  Esc/right-click cancel.
- Settings files: `%APPDATA%\com.vandal.desktop\settings.json` (installed) and
  `%APPDATA%\com.vandal.desktop.dev\` (dev builds). `vandal --settings` opens Settings.
- Dev builds use Ctrl-prefixed hotkeys (`Ctrl+Win+F12`...) so they don't clash with an installed copy.
- Synthetic-input testing from PowerShell: pass coordinates as `[int]` params. A bare `-100`
  command argument is a _string_, and `"-100" + 10` concatenates. Send arrow keys with
  `KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY`, or Windows treats them as numpad keys and drops Shift.
  Pass real scan codes too (e.g. `keybd_event(0x57, 0x11, ...)` for W): with scan code 0 the
  webview sees an empty `KeyboardEvent.code`, and our shortcuts match on `code`.
- Benchmark + pixel-alignment check: `npm run tauri build -- --no-bundle`, then
  `CAPTURE_BENCH=10 src-tauri/target/release/vandal.exe`. Record results in `internal/perf.md`.
- `CAPTURE_TRANSFER=bmp` switches the overlay transfer format.
- Releasing: `npm run release:bump -- <version>`, then tag `v<version>` and push. CI builds a draft
  GitHub release (steps in `DEVELOPMENT.md` › Releasing). Add changes under `[Unreleased]`
  in `CHANGELOG.md` as you go, with full `https://github.com/...` URLs for links to repo files
  (in a draft's notes, relative links point at a temporary `untagged-…` ref and 404).
  **Changed** lists only what users of the last release would notice: a tweak to something that
  hasn't been released yet goes into its Added entry (as it ships), not into Changed. Each release also updates the landing page and commits it
  locally in the site repo (`internal/marketing/landing-page.md` › On each release); Remind the user to deploy the landing page after the GitHub release is tested and published.
- Rust unit tests must stay on pure modules. Test binaries that link the Tauri runtime crash on
  Windows (see the PLAN decisions log).
