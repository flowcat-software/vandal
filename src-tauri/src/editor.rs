//! Editor windows (PLAN §4.1, Phase 2A): one `editor-{id}` per open document,
//! created on demand and destroyed on close.
//!
//! Each editor owns its base image in Rust memory. The page fetches it through
//! the custom protocol (`/editor/{id}`), and dropping the entry when the
//! window is destroyed frees it. The document's `crop` is a rect in that
//! image's pixels. For captures the base is the whole monitor (or monitors)
//! under the selection, so the crop can later grow back out (PLAN §4.6).
//!
//! Export (PLAN §4.6): the page renders only the annotations and POSTs them as
//! raw RGBA: highlighter strokes to `/editor/{id}/highlights` and everything
//! else to `/editor/{id}/layer`. [`export`] crops the base, multiplies the
//! highlights into it, composites the layer over that, and copies or saves in
//! Rust.
