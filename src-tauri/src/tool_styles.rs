//! The markup tools' remembered styles (PLAN 2A.6d): each tool's color,
//! width, fill, font... as the pages last left them, so the next editor (and,
//! from 2B, quick edit) starts where the user was, also after a restart.
//!
//! Kept in its own store file, not settings.json: it's working state, not
//! configuration. Rust stores it as opaque JSON text; the page owns its shape
//! and ignores anything it doesn't recognize, so adding a tool option needs no
//! change here. `editor.rememberToolStyles` off: nothing is handed out or kept.
